To extract the attribute values from the product title "Grave Before Shave Beard Care Pack (Bay Rum Blend)" in a JSON format, we will first identify the attributes present in the title. The title suggests the brand and scent, but does not explicitly mention specialty, item form, volume, or hair type. Here is the JSON representation with the identified attributes and "n/a" for those that are not applicable:
```json
{
"Brand": "Grave Before Shave",
"Specialty": "n/a",
"Item form": "n/a",
"Volume": "n/a",
"Hair type": "n/a",
"Scent": "Bay Rum"
}
```
Please note that the "Beard Care Pack" could potentially be considered as the item form or specialty, but since it is not explicitly stated, I have marked it as "n/a". If "Beard Care Pack" is indeed an attribute you wish to capture, please provide further instructions on how to classify it.
